Atlas-Engine
============

A Open-Gl/C++ game engine, To include muitiplatform support, muitiplayer, scripting, shading, voxels, and whatever else i can think of. 

Going to attempt to write it in a way that allows use of platform specific code by breaking things into modules for each part of the engine,
in theory this should be capiable of running on any system by replacing modules to support that system.
