============

A Open-Gl/C++ game engine, To include muitiplatform support, muitiplayer, scripting, shading, voxels, and whatever else i can think of. 

Going to attempt to write it in a way that allows use of platform specific code by breaking things into modules for each part of the engine, not just limited to Desktops.
